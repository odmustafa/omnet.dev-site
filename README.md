## ⚙️ Installation & Deployment

### For Siteground Hosting:
1. Upload all files to your hosting account
2. Point your domain to the uploaded folder
3. Ensure proper file permissions are set
4. Visit your website and start using terminal commands!

### File Structure:
```
omnet.dev/
├── index.html              # Main website file
├── css/
│   └── style.css          # All styling
├── js/
│   └── terminal.js        # Terminal functionality
├── admin/
│   └── config.js          # Configuration file
├── .htaccess              # Server configuration
└── README.md              # This file
```

## 🔐 Admin Panel Access

The admin panel allows you to:
- View current configuration
- Access management commands
- See site statistics
- Perform basic content updates (temporary)

**Access**: Type `admin <your_password>` in the terminal

**Note**: Admin changes are temporary and reset on page refresh. For permanent changes, regenerate the site using the bash script.

## 🎨 Customization

### To Update Content:
1. Run the bash script again with new information
2. Or edit the `admin/config.js` file directly for permanent changes
3. Use the admin panel for temporary testing

### To Change Styling:
- Edit `css/style.css` to modify colors, fonts, and layout
- The terminal theme uses CSS variables for easy color customization

### To Add New Pages:
- Edit `js/terminal.js` and add new pages to the `initializePages()` method
- Follow the existing page structure for consistency

## 🌟 Advanced Features

- **Command History**: Use ↑/↓ arrows to navigate through previous commands
- **Tab Completion**: (Future feature - can be implemented)
- **Multiple Themes**: (Future feature - can be implemented)
- **Real Email Integration**: (Can be implemented with backend)

## 🚨 Security Notes

- Admin password is stored in plain text in `config.js`
- For production use, consider implementing proper authentication
- The `.htaccess` file includes basic security headers
- Admin directory is protected by default

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome (recommended)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari
- ✅ Edge
- ✅ Mobile browsers
